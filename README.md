# 2d-tower-defense

<h2>Code week game project, a 2d tower defense game inspired by [redacted until release]</h2>

<h3>A rough overview of the project timeline:</h3>

1. Create alpha engine (v0.0.1): We will recreate the engine as Franks laboratory did it and learn + comment how every component of the engine works.
2. Beta phase part I (v0.1): We will begin implementing new features and game mechanics to make the game our own.
3. Beta phase part II: Implement secondary game features like graphics and sounds. Sounds might have to be implemented in part I, dunno yet.
4. Release candidate beta phase: AKA polishing stage. We will add stuff to make the game look and feel nice.
5. Game release, v1.0.

Tasks may be done in different order to make development organic. For example, implementing explosion animations might require adding the explosion sprites early in the beta phase instead of late; same with the sounds.

We got this guys! Our game is going to kick ass :)
